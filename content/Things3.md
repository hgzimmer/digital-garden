### Tips & Tricks

There are some views available that are not visible at first glance:
- tomorrow
- logged projects

### Automations

I tag my recurring evening tasks with a tag "evening" and have downloaded a shortcut from the Things3 website to my iPhone to run an automation to always move them to the evening on a daily basis.

I also run an Automation for specific tasks that have to be added based on recurring calendar events (i.e. if there is a certain calendar entry for this day, add a task related to it to Things3)
