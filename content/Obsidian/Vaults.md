# How man Vaults should you have?

## Just one
Simple answer: If Obsidian is your second brain, then the answer is clear: "one brain, one vault"

In one vault, it is still possible to open a folder of this vault as a vault (option "open folder as vault" in the open dialogue), this also allows sharing of parts of this vault with other people for example.

His recommendation is to start with one vault.
## Or more
But in some cases, it is useful to separate work from personal topics (e.g. programming tips vs. mindfulness journal)
This also applies to writers (e.g. one vault for all notes related to articles etc.)

He also mentions that many people have their [[Zettelkasten]] separately, because these notes are not linked to anything outside.
