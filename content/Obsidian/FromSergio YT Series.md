## About:
In his YouTube Series [Mastering Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7oLu8NfQd84_gsyqBVSVgUmCCgcvSZMx) , Sergio explains the basics of bidirectional linking, best plugins, themes and more. I like the style and his approach.

## Recommendations:
- calendar, periodic notes
- [[Kanban]] Plugin
- Recent Files
- Backups
- [[MOC - Maps of Content]]
- [[Markdown-Syntax]]


## Backups
He recommends to regularly copy the complete vault to a cloud provider (or Synology DiskStation in my case) because - as we all should know - syncing is not a backup.
