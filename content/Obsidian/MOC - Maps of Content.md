This are my notes of a session of [[FromSergio YT Series]]:

Q: Why not use a folder structure?
A: In a typical folder structure, there is an (implicit) hierarchy, but bidirectional linking allows all linking of content and leads to a much more fluid structure (a map of content)

He suggests creating a home page with the structure of:
- Home (description)
- Work (what I'm (not) working on)
- Interests (what life areas I'm (not) actively working on)
- Side Projects

Thereby, all [[MOC - Maps of Content]] are linked in one location. and all related content is linked to these pages.

Don't try to organize everything in a folder structure - allow yourself to "create first and organize later". With the MOC approach you can simply come to Obsidian an write down your thoughts.
